This repository contains *the tests* from the XProc 1.0 test suite.
The tests have been moved to this repository in order to facilitate
discussion of the tests and proposed changes to them.

Mechanically, the test suite relies on infrastructure elements
(files with specific permissions, server side redirects, and
HTTP endpoints that behave in specific ways) that would be difficult
to port to github.

The actual test suite remains at tests.xproc.org

The tests are in `tests`. To propose an amendment to a test or to propose
a new test, please issue a pull request for the appropriate test.

You can see reported processor results in `results`. To publish new
results, issue a pull request for your processor's results.
